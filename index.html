            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>To develop and validate the communication
                and control system for remotely operating the
                Rover over extensive distances with precise
                movement and efficient data transfer.</p>

            <h1>Project 2: Robotic Arm</h1>
            <img src="Robotic_Arm.jpg" alt="Project 2 Image">
            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>We will firstly be work on the controls of motors
                using microcontrollers.
                Then jump to Robotics with use of Inverse
                Kinematics for arm movement
                In the end: The arm wil be able to pick and
                place a randomly placed object autonomously
                <p>

            <h1>Project 3 : Autonomous Navigation of Mars Rover. </h1>
            <img src="Mars_Rover.jpg" alt="Project 3 Image">
            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>To design and simulate the system of
                autonomous navigation for the mars rover
                which mainly covers up obstacle detection and
                classification, obstacle avoidance and path
                planning to a specific location</p>

            <h1>Project 4 : Gyrobot:Self Balancing Robot</h1>
            <img src="Gyrobot.jpg" alt="Project 4 Image">
            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>A two-wheeled self-balancing robot that
                achieves perfect equilibrium, using technology and
                precision engineering.
                The robot has locomotion capabilities while maintaining
                its balance similar to humans</p>
